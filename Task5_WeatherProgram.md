Title: Basic Weather Analysis

    Write a program that stores the temperatures of the given days
and reports the average temperature of those given days with the
information that how many of them were higher than the average.

1. Get the number of days:

   Create a function that asks the user how many 
days will be taken into consideration and then make a 
storage area for the given amount.

2. Get the temperatures:

   Get the values from the user and assign them 
to the created storage.

3. Report:

   Make a brief overall report of given days' average
temperature and how many days were above it.

```
### Sample Case
```

How many days' temperatures? 7

Day 1's high temp: 45
Day 2's high temp: 44
Day 3's high temp: 39
Day 4's high temp: 48
Day 5's high temp: 37
